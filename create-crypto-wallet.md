# Create  crypto wallet

The premise of using SparkLink is to have a crypto wallet and it is the only way to spend and earn. We support crypto wallets such as MetaMask or TokenPocket etc. The address of the crypto wallet is the only certificate of your account. The address generated by a crypto wallet (such as MetaMask) is as unique as your bank account. You must have the wallet address to store your digital currency or process transactions.

SparkLink is a tool for interacting with the block chain. We do not keep your assets or NFT. We provide a peer-to-peer exchange system to allow anyone interacting with other people on the block chain and conduct NFT transactions. The function of the crypto wallet is to convert operations on the website into transactions on the block chain.

After you have a crypto wallet, you need to connect your crypto wallet to SparkLink for operation.
