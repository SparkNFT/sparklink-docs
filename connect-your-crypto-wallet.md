# Connect your crypto wallet

In order to connect your wallet to SparkLink, click on the SparkLink.io homepage, select the Connect Wallet icon in the upper right corner, and select the wallet you are currently using.

Then the system will prompt a connection request, please follow the prompts to operate. When you see "Connecting..." SparkLink to your wallet, it's almost done.

After clicking the link button, your wallet will be successfully linked to the platform. But don't worry, you just linked SparkLink by signing, and the ownership of the encrypted wallet and the assets in it will always belong to you.

Now you are ready! If you have trouble creating, sharing, and viewing collections, please make sure that your wallet is properly connected.
