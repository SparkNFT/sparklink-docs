# Download

The download function is the function of downloading NFT content. It is divided into two download modes, one is encrypted release and can be downloaded after purchase; the other is open source release which can be downloaded by anyone.

Encrypted NFT content must be purchased before downloading its content; anyone can download and view the content of open-source published works.
